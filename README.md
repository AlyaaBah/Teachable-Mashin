# Teachable-Mashin
Image classification model trained with Teachable Machine using three classes: Bow, Cherry, and Panther.

🧠 Image Classification with Teachable Machine
This project demonstrates how to use a machine learning model trained with Teachable Machine to classify images into three categories: Bow, Cherry, and Panther. It’s a simple yet powerful example of deploying a pre-trained image classifier using Python and TensorFlow in Google Colab.

🧰 Files Included
keras_Model.h5: The trained image classification model.
labels.txt: The list of class labels used by the model.
predict.py: Python script to load the model and classify a given image.
Sample image(s) for testing.
🖼️ Classes
The model was trained using the following three classes:

Class Name	Description
Bow	Images of bows (e.g., hair bows, ribbons)
Cherry	Images of cherries
Panther	Images of panthers or similar animals
▶️ How to Use
Upload the model files (keras_Model.h5, labels.txt) and your image to Google Colab.
Run the provided Python script to classify the image.
The script will output the predicted class and confidence score.
📌 Notes
The model was trained using Teachable Machine’s image project interface.
Input images are resized to 224×224 and normalized before prediction.
The model is used for inference only and not intended for retraining.
For best results, use clear and centered images similar to the training samples.
